## Changes in 3.0.0
### Features
- Added the ability to get a discount on Windows VM pricing if you have on-premises licenses for the OS SKUs you are deploying, via `licenseType` on `VirtualMachineConfiguration`.
- Added support for attaching empty data drives to `VirtualMachineConfiguration` based pools, via the new `dataDisks` property on `VirtualMachineConfiguration`.
- **[Breaking]** Custom images must now be deployed using a reference to an ARM Image, instead of pointing to .vhd files in blobs directly.
  - The new `virtualMachineImageId` property on `ImageReference` contains the reference to the ARM Image, and `OSDisk.imageUris` no longer exists.
  - Because of this, `imageReference` is now a required property of `VirtualMachineConfiguration`.
- **[Breaking]** Multi-instance tasks (created using `MultiInstanceSettings`) must now specify a `coordinationCommandLine`, and `numberOfInstances` is now optional and defaults to 1.
- Added support for tasks run using Docker containers. To run a task using a Docker container you must specify a `containerConfiguration` on the `VirtualMachineConfiguration` for a pool, and then add `taskContainerSettings` on the Task.
